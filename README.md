# codegym-task-1501
try shortining
The program reads a string from the console and displays it in all lowercase letters.
Without changing the functionality of the program, rewrite the code using a try-with-resources statement.

Put the creation of objects that use external resources inside the parentheses. Remember to remove the unnecessary calls to the close() method.

Requirements:
•	The program should read a string from the console and display it in all lowercase letters.
•	The program must use the try-with-resources statement as outlined in the task conditions.
•	The close() method must not be explicitly called on objects that use external resources.
